# CUDA Examples

Welcome to the CUDA Examples! This repository contains a collection of simple yet illustrative examples to demonstrate the use of NVIDIA's CUDA technology for parallel computing. The examples cover a range of operations and techniques frequently employed in CUDA programming, making it an ideal starting point for those new to CUDA or looking for reference implementations of common patterns.

# Repository Structure

Each example in this repository is a standalone CUDA program. The examples are designed to illustrate specific concepts in CUDA programming, such as vector operations, matrix multiplication, activation functions in neural networks, convolution operations, normalization, and dropout techniques.

# Building the Examples
We use CMake as our build system. Below are the instructions to compile the examples.

# Prerequisites
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher.
CUDA Toolkit (recommended version 10.0 or higher).
CMake (version 3.0.0 or higher).
A C++ compiler compatible with the CUDA Toolkit.
Compilation Steps
Clone the Repository:

```bash
Copy code
git clone [URL to CUDA Examples Repository]
cd [Repository Name]
```

```bash
cmake -S . -B build

cmake --build build

```

## Running an Example
After compilation, you can run an example as follows:

```bash
./[ExampleName]
```
Replace [ExampleName] with the name of the executable you wish to run.
